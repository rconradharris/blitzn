App:
    Add version information on Settings page (define versionCode and versionName)
    
    Specify API version requirement in manifest
        Requirements enforced by the Android Market server:
        Your application must be signed with a cryptographic private key whose
        validity period ends after 22 October 2033.
        Your application must define both an android:versionCode and an
        android:versionName attribute in the <manifest> element of its manifest. The
        server uses the android:versionCode as the basis for identifying the
        application internally and handling updates, and it displays the
        android:versionName to users as the application's version.
        Your application must define both an android:icon and an android:label
        attribute in the <application> element of its manifest.

Save Activity State - see onSaveInstanceState() onRestoreInstanceState()

Perhaps pull "Settings" onto different page, and leave time related settings on
SetTime. Idea is "Settings" is rare, "SetTime" is common.

Splash screen that run on first install that explains basic operation.
Possible help button.
