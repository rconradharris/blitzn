Tournament Version

From Wikipedia:
"The World Chess Federation FIDE sets a single time control for all major FIDE
events: 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest
of the game with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one."

Padding (or margin) on lower button to bottom of screen looks smaller than
Top Button to Top of screen (occurs sporadically on HTC Incredible).
Replicated this by hitting settings button, then hit back. Bottom margin
should be missing. Now hit menu again, layout should be pushed up and margin
restored.

Add setting for "Keep Screen On Running" ?

Add milliseconds (just under 5 seconds, or forever?)

Show Opponent Time right side up for each player

Splash Screen

About Page

Save Activity State - see onSaveInstanceState() onRestoreInstanceState()

Perhaps pull "Settings" onto different page, and leave time related settings on
SetTime. Idea is "Settings" is rare, "SetTime" is common.

Settings page with swipe-to-set widget:
    * Support common settings
    * Support custom times
    * Allow favoriting of custom times

Themes?

Rotate numbers sideways vs mirror

Font options (non LED?) Underline perhaps? or a different font

Allow player to click on Paused dialog to unapuse it. Tried this, more
difficult than I thought it would be. Punting for now.
