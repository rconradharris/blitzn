License Verification Library Steps:

Obfuscate Code with ProGuard: proguard.sourceforge.net

Priorities:
    * Rename Accumulate back to Fischer (?)
    * Update Blog to use new launcher icon
    * License Enforcement
    * Touch-ups (Pause Icon, move counter, power manage tweaks)
    * Promo Graphic?
    * Publicize on other marketplaces?

Blitzn Next Release v1.4
========================

    Features:

        Improve About Page Text

    Code-cleanup:

    Bugs:

        Can we remove the warning generated due to vibration permission? Use haptic feedback?

        
        Screen is remaining on when chess clock is stopped

        In initial READY mode screen stays on forever.

        Pause Icon is a little too light gray

Unpriortizied
=============

Bronstein should delay before starting clock, not add back. (NOTSURE)

IMPORTANT: Internationalize! (German, French, Spanish)
Use Amazon Turk to internationalize strings.xml

Create swipey number selector

Use wakelock? or Power manager?

Add Move Counter to Main screen

Unpause dialog currently shakes as the screen returns to full-screen.
Is there a fix here?

Increase accuracy of timing logic (you can hear discrepencies in Time Pressure
mode, it doesn't quite keep the beat)
Timepressure siren is ticking too quickly. Can this be fixed?

Move Blitzn Preferences out to a Preference Manager (its mucking up the main
activity)

Provide a way to get back to the hints page

Add FIDE tournament mode, from Wikipedia:
"The World Chess Federation FIDE sets a single time control for all major FIDE
events: 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest
of the game with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one."

Padding (or margin) on lower button to bottom of screen looks smaller than
Top Button to Top of screen (occurs sporadically on HTC Incredible).
Replicated this by hitting settings button, then hit back. Bottom margin
should be missing. Now hit menu again, layout should be pushed up and margin
restored.

Save Activity State - see onSaveInstanceState() onRestoreInstanceState()

Settings page with swipe-to-set widget:
    * Support common settings
    * Support custom times
    * Allow favoriting of custom times


Allow player to click on Paused dialog to unapuse it. Tried this, more
difficult than I thought it would be. Punting for now.

Themes?

Add link to webpage help

Maybe Not
=========

Add delay counter on main page.

Add Hourglass

Hints - When the user clicks on a particular delay method for the first time,
it should pop a box that contains an explanation of that particular method.
The box should include a Show Tips checkbox.

Create Time Control menu: set duration and delay there. This page will reset
the clock if the values are manipulated. Settings page will no longer reset
clock if values tweaked.

Rebrand Blitzn as Blitzn Pro and Create free limited version of Blitzn.
Tournament Version

Add Favorites:
    Favorites will a tuple of (duration, delay_method, delay_time)
    Bullet (1, None, _)
    Lightning (3, FISCHER_AFTER, 2)
    Blitz  (1, None, _)
    Custom 1
    Custom 2

Splash Screen

Font options (non LED?) Underline perhaps? or a different font

Rotate numbers sideways vs mirror

Add setting for "Keep Screen On Running" ?

Show Opponent Time right side up for each player


Ideas
=====

Maybe git commit msg should just be used rather than CHANGELOG (no need to
duplicate effort)

Free will have limited features and be ad-supported.

Port Blitzn to iPhone.

Release in GetJar, Amazon and Verizon app stores.

Barleysoft
==========

    Create Barleysoft logo: Barley leaf
    Play inaugural game, then tweet it

    Create help page:
        barleysoft.com/blitzn/help, include:
            * Real life photos, shot of blitzn used on a park table
            * Video to demonstrate Shake-to-Reset, Flip-To-Pause
