App:

    Specify API version requirement in manifest
        Requirements enforced by the Android Market server:
        Your application must be signed with a cryptographic private key whose
        validity period ends after 22 October 2033.
        Your application must define both an android:versionCode and an
        android:versionName attribute in the <manifest> element of its manifest. The
        server uses the android:versionCode as the basis for identifying the
        application internally and handling updates, and it displays the
        android:versionName to users as the application's version.
        Your application must define both an android:icon and an android:label
        attribute in the <application> element of its manifest.

Make default something other than 1+0 (might not be an issue)

Padding (or margin) on lower button to bottom of screen looks smaller than
Top Button to Top of screen (occurs sporadically on HTC Incredible).
Replicated this by hitting settings button, then hit back. Bottom margin
should be missing. Now hit menu again, layout should be pushed up and margin
restored.

Add setting for "Keep Screen On Running" ?

Catch UnsupportedOperation exceptions from ShakeListener and
PitchFlipListener

Add milliseconds (just under 5 seconds, or forever?)

Show Opponent Time right side up for each player

Pull Shake-to-reset and Flip to Pause into strings.xml as well as menu text.

Splash Screen

About Page

Save Activity State - see onSaveInstanceState() onRestoreInstanceState()

Perhaps pull "Settings" onto different page, and leave time related settings on
SetTime. Idea is "Settings" is rare, "SetTime" is common.

Splash screen that run on first install that explains basic operation.
Possible help button.

Settings page with swipe-to-set widget:
    * Support common settings
    * Support customer times

Themes?

Make states an Enum

Rotate numbers sideways vs mirror

Font options (non LED?) Underline perhaps? or a different font
