Blitzn Next Release v1.1
========================

    Features:

    Code-cleanup:
        Spinners currently parse directly, we should use IDs to decouple the
        spinner logic from a particular language.

    Bugs:
        In initial READY mode screen stays on forever.

        Timepressure siren is ticking too quickly.

        Unpause dialog currently shakes as the screen returns to full-screen.
        Is there a fix here?

Unpriortizied
=============

Increase accuracy of timing logic (you can hear discrepencies in Time Pressure
mode, it doesn't quite keep the beat)

Pause Icon is a little too light gray

Add delay counter on main page.

Add Hourglass

Hints - When the user clicks on a particular delay method for the first time,
it should pop a box that contains an explanation of that particular method.
The box should include a Show Tips checkbox.

Create better launch icon

Create Time Control menu: set duration and delay there. This page will reset
the clock if the values are manipulated. Settings page will no longer reset
clock if values tweaked.

Rebrand Blitzn as Blitzn Pro and Create free limited version of Blitzn.
Tournament Version

Improve UI Phase 1:
    Make LED timer look more realistic
    Add 3D to the buttons.
    Add glowing red light to indicate time is running.

Use Amazon Turk to internationalize strings.xml

Provide a way to get back to the hints page

Add Favorites:
    Favorites will a tuple of (duration, delay_method, delay_time)
    Bullet (1, None, _)
    Lightning (3, FISCHER_AFTER, 2)
    Blitz  (1, None, _)
    Custom 1
    Custom 2



Add FIDE tournament mode, from Wikipedia:
"The World Chess Federation FIDE sets a single time control for all major FIDE
events: 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest
of the game with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one."

Padding (or margin) on lower button to bottom of screen looks smaller than
Top Button to Top of screen (occurs sporadically on HTC Incredible).
Replicated this by hitting settings button, then hit back. Bottom margin
should be missing. Now hit menu again, layout should be pushed up and margin
restored.

Splash Screen

About Page

Save Activity State - see onSaveInstanceState() onRestoreInstanceState()

Settings page with swipe-to-set widget:
    * Support common settings
    * Support custom times
    * Allow favoriting of custom times


Allow player to click on Paused dialog to unapuse it. Tried this, more
difficult than I thought it would be. Punting for now.

Themes?

Add link to webpage help


Maybe Not
=========

Font options (non LED?) Underline perhaps? or a different font

Rotate numbers sideways vs mirror

Add setting for "Keep Screen On Running" ?

Show Opponent Time right side up for each player


Ideas
=====

Maybe git commit msg should just be used rather than CHANGELOG (no need to
duplicate effort)

Free will have limited features and be ad-supported.

Port Blitzn to iPhone.

Release in GetJar, Amazon and Verizon app stores.
