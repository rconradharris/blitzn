Blitzn Next Release v1.1
========================

    Features:
        Improved Time-delay code, support:
            * None [DONE]
            * Fischer [DONE]
            * Bronstein [DONE]
            
        Menu Icons
        
    Code-cleanup:
        Spinners currently parse directly, we should use IDs to decouple the
        spinner logic from a particular language.

    Bugs:
        Catch UnsupportedOperation exceptions from ShakeListener and
        PitchFlipListener
        
        Unpause dialog currently shakes as the screen returns to full-screen.
        Is there a fix here?

Unpriortizied
=============

Add delay counter on main page.

Add Hourglass

Should we round the the numbers? Adding +5 delay looks like 4 because after
the first 100th of a second, it becomes 4.99 which truncates down to 4.

Hints - When the user clicks on a particular delay method for the first time,
it should pop a box that contains an explanation of that particular method.
The box should include a Show Tips checkbox.

Rather than use DelayStrategyFactory, maybe we can embed this logic into
DelayContext. DelayContext would take a delayStrategyId and look up the
strategy factory. DelayContext would also add getDelayStrategyId().

Create better launch icon

Create Time Control menu: set duration and delay there. This page will reset
the clock if the values are manipulated. Settings page will no longer reset
clock if values tweaked.

Rebrand Blitzn as Blitzn Pro and Create free limited version of Blitzn.
Tournament Version

Improve UI Phase 1:
    Make LED timer look more realistic
    Add 3D to the buttons.
    Add glowing red light to indicate time is running.

Decouple ChessClock from BlitznActivity

Use Amazon Turk to internationalize strings.xml

Provide a way to get back to the hints page

Add Favorites:
    Favorites will a tuple of (duration, delay_method, delay_time)
    Bullet (1, None, _)
    Lightning (3, FISCHER_AFTER, 2)
    Blitz  (1, None, _)
    Custom 1
    Custom 2



Add FIDE tournament mode, from Wikipedia:
"The World Chess Federation FIDE sets a single time control for all major FIDE
events: 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest
of the game with an addition of 30 seconds per move starting from move one."

Padding (or margin) on lower button to bottom of screen looks smaller than
Top Button to Top of screen (occurs sporadically on HTC Incredible).
Replicated this by hitting settings button, then hit back. Bottom margin
should be missing. Now hit menu again, layout should be pushed up and margin
restored.

Splash Screen

About Page

Save Activity State - see onSaveInstanceState() onRestoreInstanceState()

Settings page with swipe-to-set widget:
    * Support common settings
    * Support custom times
    * Allow favoriting of custom times


Allow player to click on Paused dialog to unapuse it. Tried this, more
difficult than I thought it would be. Punting for now.

Low Time Mode
    Make warning noise (siren)
    Flash clock?
    Add milliseconds (just under 5 seconds, or forever?)

Themes?

Add link to webpage help

Font options (non LED?) Underline perhaps? or a different font

Rotate numbers sideways vs mirror

Add setting for "Keep Screen On Running" ?
