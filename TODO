    Specify API version requirement in manifest
        Requirements enforced by the Android Market server:
        Your application must be signed with a cryptographic private key whose
        validity period ends after 22 October 2033.
        Your application must define both an android:versionCode and an
        android:versionName attribute in the <manifest> element of its manifest. The
        server uses the android:versionCode as the basis for identifying the
        application internally and handling updates, and it displays the
        android:versionName to users as the application's version.
        Your application must define both an android:icon and an android:label
        attribute in the <application> element of its manifest.

Splash screen that run on first install that explains basic operation.
