Mechanics
    - A dialog should appear when pause is initated by the player (via phone
      flip or via menu)
    - A dialog should not appear when paused by system by leaving the activity
      (via Settings Page or hitting Home button)
    - On resuming from a non-player initiated pause, we should leave the clock
      puased and re-emit the paused dialog.

Time Control
    - Increment should increase time in clock when appropriate

Persistence
    - The app should persist configuration options when activity is left and
      returned to

Motion Detection
    - Clock should pause when phone is flipped face down
    - Clock should unpause when phone is turned face up

    - Clock should reset (if game is in progress or stopped but not already
      reset) when shaken
    - The motion detection not be active when on settings page

Sound
    - Sound enable/disable on the settings page should work (and persist
      between sessions)
    - Clock should still click if players click fast enough to cause two
      simultaneous clicks.

Power Management
    - Phone should turn off when game is not in progress: clock never started,
      clock STOPPED after a player loss, clock READY after a reset
    - Phone should remain on when game is in progress

Misc
    - Ensure Intro Dialog is displayed on first load (but never after that)
